# **d a Traffic Sign Recognition Classifier** 

### Reflection

### 1. Describe of pipeline.
1. Load Dataset;
2. Give distribution of classes in the training, validation and test set; Visulize an random image in train data set;
3. Preprocess train dataset using augmentation, center normalize, RGB2gray techniques
4. Define Model Architecture,train pipeline, model evaluate funtion
5. Train model using L2 normalization pennalty and dropout techniques
6. Use test dataset to evaluate trained model
7.

### 2. shortcomings


### 3. Suggest possible improvements to project
