With parameter sharing, each neuron in an output channel shares its weights with every other neuron in that channel.
(也就是说filter窗口在原始图像上sliding的时候，权重不变，所以每个输出channel 只有 filter HXWXD个参数)
So the number of parameters is equal to the number of neurons in the filter, plus a bias neuron, 
all multiplied by the number of channels in the output layer.
